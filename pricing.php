        <h1 class='supertitle'>Above average service, at below average prices.</h1>
        <h1>Competitive Standard Rates</h1>
        <p>Our quotes are developed based on an estimate of how many work hours will go into your project. We use an hourly rate to calculate your final cost, that way you don't pay for more than you need.</p>
        <p>We want to be up front with what you are paying for, so here is a quick break down.</p>
        <h2>What You Pay For</h2>
        <p><strong>Design Research and Development</strong> - In the process of developing your site, we need to get to know your brand, and your customers. Our designer will collect your current branding material, offer suggestions for improvements, and use the result to design the new website.</p>
        <p><strong>Content Development</strong> - You may have a lot to say, that's great! However, the web is a different environment, so your standard print media will need to be revised to fit the format.</p>
        <p><strong>Keyword Research and Saturation</strong> - You could have the next Facebook or Twitter ready for your users, but it doesn't do any good if no one can find it! We do the market research for you, and make sure your site is attracting the right visitors, and a lot of them.<sup class='tiny'>2</sup></p>
        <p><strong>Site Development and Quality Assurance</strong> - We build your site from the ground up. This isn't a Wordpress theme, we are going to put together a rock solid coding masterpiece, and you will notice the difference.</p>
        <p><strong>Worry Free Hosting</strong> - Don't know what a DNS Record is? Don't worry about it. We will set up your web address, upload your scripts, and keep everything running. All you have to do is keep up with your subscription.</p>
        <div class='spacer'></div>
        <h2>What You Don't Pay For</h2>
        <p><strong>Time spent in meetings</strong> - Meetings are a necessary evil, and they suck up nearly 15% of most development budgets. But rest assured, S3 will absorb the cost of paying our team to work with yours, so you don't have to worry about it.</p>
        <p><strong>Minor Updates and New Content</strong> - Have a new image for a page? Need an entire new page added to your site? No problem. As long as you are hosting with us, we will make your changes, free of charge<sup class='tiny'>1, 2</sup>.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Management Overhead</strong> - Websites are tricky, and there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of. But that is our problem, not yours. If the time we spend isn't directly applied to your final product, it's not your cost.</p>
        <div class='spacer'></div>
        <h2>Flex-Rate Program</h2>
        <p>Websites can get expensive. But we don't want that to keep your business offline! If you don't think you can afford our prices, let us know. We will work with you to find a rate that works. You get online, we still get paid, win-win.</p>
        <div class='spacer'></div>
        <h2>When do I pay?</h2>
        <p>Our pay schedule is pretty straight forward.</p>
