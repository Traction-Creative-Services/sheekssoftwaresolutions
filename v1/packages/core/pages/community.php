<h2>Business as a Community Member</h2>
<p>10% of all profits earned on any contract we sign is donated to a partner charity of our client's choice. These organizations work directly to solve problems in our local community, and improve the livelihood of humanity worldwide. If the charity you would like to partner with is not listed, please feel free to suggest another option. The charity will, however, need to be approved by our company in order to qualify for a contract donation.</p>
