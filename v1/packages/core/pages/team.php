    I have been working in computer support and development since 2008. I love piecing together a complex project, or just pounding out a simple solution. Aside from computer work, I enjoy alpine skiing, biking, and Role Playing style games. I also enjoy spending time with my wife, Heidi, and my roommates.</p>

    I have been a practicing designer for about four years. When hashing out projects, I tend to relish making a mess and experimenting with multiple mediums, often yielding some unconventional solutions. I also enjoy playing the djembe, baking bread, and various tabletop RPGs.</p>

    I'm a designer / photographer by trade, but I like to dabble in a little bit of a everything. I feel that knowing a little bit about a lot of things can go a long ways. When I'm not busy creating I like to spend my time disc golfing, running, cycling, gaming, and most importantly petting my dog.</p>
