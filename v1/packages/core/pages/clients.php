<p>

Eat Street Players was started as a revival of Theater 1900, the resident theater company in the Howard Conn Theater at Plymouth Congregational Church. Theater 1900 was started by some of the same folks who started Theater in the Round, and performed during the 70s and 80s. It stopped producing around 1990. In 2005, a new company was formed to take up the baton, or the torch, or the whoopie cushion, whatever is appropriate to take up, and we've been performing since then. After a little work trying to find a name, we landed on Eat Street Players, cuz we're playing on Eat Street. See? Nicollet Avenue? Anyway, you should eat there, and then see one of our shows.</p>
