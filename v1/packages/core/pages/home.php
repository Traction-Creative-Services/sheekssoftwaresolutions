<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>S3's goal is to provide simple, highly usable design, at an affordable price. Our sites are designed to drive organic visits and provide search engine optimized pages to help gain audience from Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and other major search engines.</p>
<h2>Why Work With Us?</h2>
<p>S3 works one on one with its clients to provide a highly personal web design experience. Our end product is made specifically to fit your needs, so it is important for us to keep an open dialog with our clients. Unlike other large design companies, we have a small team of skilled individuals who work with you directly, getting you the best possible product, in a shorter time frame. On top of that, our team is built of both code developers, and graphic designers, so you can get all of the work done in one seamless package.</p>
